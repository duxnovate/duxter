## Why Using Duxter

## "Created for Those Who Want to Avoid the Hassle of Starting from Scratch"

This project is designed specifically for developers who want to quickly set up a web application without the tedious process of configuring everything from the ground up. Here‚Äôs what this means:

### 1. **Time-Saving Setup**

Setting up a web application can often be time-consuming, involving multiple steps such as configuring the server, setting up a database, and managing dependencies. This project provides a pre-configured template that significantly reduces setup time, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than managing configurations.

### 2. **Best Practices Implemented**

The project incorporates best practices in modern web development. This includes the use of TypeScript for type safety, dotenv for environment management, and Fastify for efficient routing and performance. By using this project, developers can start with a strong foundation that adheres to industry standards.

### 3. **Ease of Use**

With a clear directory structure and comprehensive documentation, developers can easily navigate through the codebase. The pre-defined scripts in `package.json` facilitate common tasks such as starting the server, building the application, and running migrations, making it user-friendly for both beginners and experienced developers.

### 4. **Modular Architecture**

The modular architecture allows for easy extensions and modifications. Developers can add new features or adjust existing ones without needing to rewrite large portions of code. This flexibility is particularly valuable for projects that may evolve over time.

### 5. **Educational Resource**

For those new to web development, this project serves as a practical educational resource. It demonstrates how to structure an application, manage dependencies, and utilize modern tools effectively, providing a valuable learning experience.

In summary, this project is tailored for developers who prefer to skip the cumbersome setup process and dive straight into application development, making it an excellent choice for both rapid prototyping and long-term projects.

# Conclusion

This project is an application built using **Fastify** as an efficient web framework and **TypeScript** to enhance code reliability and quality. The use of **Bun** as a runtime enables faster development with better dependency management.

## Project Advantages

- **Performance**: Fastify and Pino ensure that the application can handle multiple requests quickly.
- **Security**: Separation of configuration with `.env` enhances security by keeping sensitive data separate from the source code.
- **Readability**: The use of TypeScript and a modular structure makes the code easier to read and maintain.
- **Flexibility**: Knex and dotenv provide flexibility in database interactions and environment configuration, allowing for faster and more responsive development to changing needs.

By leveraging this combination of technologies, the project is designed to be a fast, secure, and easily extendable application.

# Project Utility

This project serves as a foundational web application designed to efficiently handle HTTP requests and interact with a PostgreSQL database. Here are the key utilities of the project:

## 1. Web Application Development

The project provides a framework for building robust web applications. With Fastify, developers can create APIs and web services that are optimized for speed and performance.

## 2. Database Interaction

By utilizing Knex as a query builder, the project simplifies the interaction with the PostgreSQL database. This allows for smooth data manipulation, including querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

## 3. Environment Configuration

The inclusion of dotenv allows for secure and flexible configuration management. Developers can easily manage environment-specific variables, making it straightforward to deploy the application across different environments (development, testing, production) without modifying the codebase.

## 4. Type Safety

Using TypeScript enhances code reliability by providing type safety. This reduces the likelihood of runtime errors and improves the overall maintainability of the code, allowing for easier refactoring and collaboration among developers.

## 5. Logging and Monitoring

The integration of Pino for logging provides a fast and efficient way to monitor application performance and behavior. This is crucial for debugging and maintaining the health of the application.

## 6. Scalability

The project's architecture is designed to support scalability. As the application grows, the modular structure allows developers to extend functionality without compromising performance.

## 7. Educational Tool

For learners and new developers, this project serves as an excellent educational tool. It demonstrates best practices in modern web development, including the use of TypeScript, environment management, and efficient database interactions.

By utilizing this project, developers can quickly bootstrap a web application while benefiting from the features and utilities provided by the chosen technologies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

### Before running the project, configure the environment variables. You can create a .env file by copying the example configuration:

```bash
bun run env
```

This command will copy .env.example to .env, where you can modify the variables as needed (such as database configuration, server port, etc.).

## üöÄ Available Scripts

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application in Development Mode

To run the application with automatic reloading on file changes:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This script will start the application using main.ts and watch for any changes, automatically reloading the server when files are updated.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Migrations

To execute database migrations, use the following command:

```bash
bun run migrate
```

This will run the migration script located at src/database/config/migrate.ts, applying any new SQL migration files in your migrations directory.

## üìö Requirements

- Bun v1.1.29 or higher
- Node.js (for certain dependencies)
- PostgreSQL (as the database engine)
- Ensure your .env file is configured correctly for the PostgreSQL connection.
